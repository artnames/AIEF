# Contributing to AIEF

Thanks for helping improve the AI Execution Integrity Framework (AIEF).

## Good issue/PR format
Please include:
- Section number(s) affected
- The problem you see
- Proposed wording (if you have it)
- Rationale and any real-world examples

## What we're looking for
- Clearer definitions and semantics
- Missing threat vectors or failure modes
- Improvements to control objectives and test procedures
- Interoperability recommendations
- Practical privacy-preserving integrity patterns

## Style guidelines
- Keep changes small and scoped
- Use consistent MUST/SHOULD/MAY wording
- Avoid expanding scope into model correctness, fairness, or governance programs unless necessary for execution integrity

## Versioning
Edits should target the next draft version. If you propose a semantics change, include a suggested version bump note for the changelog.
