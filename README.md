# AI Execution Integrity Framework (AIEF)

AIEF defines baseline control objectives and evidence expectations for **verifiable AI execution records** — focusing on **integrity of the record**, not correctness of the decision.

**Current draft:** v0.2.5 (Public Comment)  
**Spec:** See [SPEC.md](./SPEC.md)

## What this is for
Systems where AI-driven decisions or actions may need auditability, defensibility, or long-term traceability (regulated SaaS workflows, fintech, public sector, enterprise automation, agentic workflows).

## What this is not
AIEF does not define model safety, fairness/bias requirements, or require deterministic model outputs.

## Contributing
